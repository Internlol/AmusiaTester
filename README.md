#Amusia Tester
What does it do?
Test your ability to distinguish between certain tones. Amusia is a condition where someone is unable to distinguish between pitches and music perception - it affects about 4% of the population, which is a decent amount considering the amount of music people listen to.

How to run the demo
Press the restart button to begin the demo. On the computer screen, you will be given directions on what to do.
There are 3 rounds of testing, turned into a game.
1) Testing your memory of a certain frequency
2) Comparing different frequencies
3) A test on pitch in a different octave. This one is difficult!
Upon getting right or wrong, you will hear some frequencies. If you win, you should hear the frequency increasing then decreasing. If you lose, you should hear a higher frequency and then a lower frequency alternating. If you canâ€™t tell, that may be a sign!
After you pass all 3 rounds, you will be able to get your ears rewarded by a (hopefully!) familiar tune on loop.
